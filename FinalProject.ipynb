    "In the e-commerce industry, being able to predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase is essential for designing effective recommendation systems, targeted marketing strategies, and personalized user experiences (Ding et al., 2015; Rajamma et al., 2009). Unlike in physical retail settings where sales associates can rely on experience, intuition, and real-time interactions to guide customers, online platforms must rely entirely on algorithmic decision-making (Moe, 2003). This creates a strong need for data-driven models that can identify which aspects of a user’s browsing behaviour are most informative for predicting the likelihood of a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because online shopping datasets often include many behavioural, technical, and session-related variables, traditional regression models can struggle due to multicollinearity and the presence of weak or redundant predictors. Regularization methods such as the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) offer a robust solution by performing variable selection and reducing overfitting, making them well-suited for high-dimensional settings common in e-commerce analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The guiding research question of this project is:**\n",
    " - Which combination of session-level and behavioural features provides the strongest predictive accuracy for determining whether an online shopper completes a purchase, and how does predictive performance change as we fit multiple LASSO models with varying penalty values?\n",
    " \n",
    "Because the data come from naturally occurring online browsing sessions rather than a controlled experiment, it is not possible to draw causal conclusions about how specific variables influence purchasing behaviour. For this reason, our research question is intentionally focused on *prediction*, aiming to identify which combination of features yields the most accurate model rather than estimating the effect of any individual variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This predictive approach mirrors existing work in e-commerce analytics, where retailers commonly use machine-learning–based recommendation systems, clickstream models, and regularized regression techniques to forecast customer actions and personalize online experiences (Chen, 2025; Narvekar & Banu, 2015; Satu & Islam, 2023). By evaluating how different levels of LASSO regularization improve predictive performance, our project aligns with these established modeling strategies used across the industry.\n"
